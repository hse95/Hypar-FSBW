### Designation Guide

This section provides a detailed explanation of the test designations:

1. **Hydrostatic**  
   Calculates the hydrostatic force on the structure without the presence of any wave.

2. **Rn025_NF**  
   Hammer test results to determine the natural frequency of the \(R_n = 0.25\) structure.

3. **Rn025_T1_N75**  
   Force measurements for the \(R_n = 0.25\) structure under wave conditions with:
   - Wave period T = 1.04s
   - Half immersion (N means negative where bottom of FSBW is below the water level) with draft of 75 mm or 7.5 cm.

4. **WG_Rn025_T1_N75**  
   Wave gauge readings collected during the same test for $(R_n = 0.25\$, $T = 1.04 \, \text{s}\$, and \(7.5 \, \text{cm}\) draft.
